# Proposal Context

We chose this project generally because recently, as you might’ve known, the James Webb Space telescope sent back marvelous high-resolution images of galaxies, nebulas, black holes, and more. These new images will allow us to have a greater understanding of the history of our universe, recording information about collisions of galaxies and births of stars. Being inspired by this phenomenal event, we’ve decided to use what we’ve learnt in the course and try to simulate a solar system, mainly using the libraries matplotlib and numpy.
